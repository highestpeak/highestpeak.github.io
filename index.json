Where do I come from? Where am I going? In CMD and BASH, the WHOAMI command tells the user their current username. While this is a straightforward self-query from a computer’s perspective, for humans, understanding one’s true identity and future direction is much more complex. Most people can’t answer “WHOAMI” with the same clarity as a computer, which is a luxury. During my secondary education in China, I experienced a traditional and rigid system. Although these experiences are not a source of pride, I value the knowledge and lessons I gained, as they were earned through my efforts rather than given to me. Later, I attended the School of Software at Sichuan University, where I enjoyed more freedom and a broader perspective. I met many people and learned a great deal. Looking back, I realize there were many areas where I could have done better, though trial and error and wasted time are often part of growth. Overall, university was one of my happiest times. Since 2021, I have been working in the efficiency engineering department at Kuaishou, focusing on the development, optimization, and maintenance of collaborative office software. I have had the fortune of working with excellent colleagues, participating in meaningful projects, and growing technically. I am grateful for these experiences. My dream is to become an independent developer, with a few products that sustain me, allowing me more time to study history and computer science, engage in open-source projects, and develop useful software for friends worldwide. I will work towards this goal, but I also need to earn a living, so I will continue working for the company while striving towards my personal objectives.

Building Influence: As someone aiming to become an independent developer, I need a platform to build influence and attract my first users. Meeting New People: A blog can help new friends, both online and offline, get to know me better. Recording Life: A blog serves as a record of my life, leaving a trace of time that I can look back on. I hope to say one day, “I existed, and many people knew I existed.” Content Discussion and Critique: Engaging in online discussions and critiques helps refine my thinking and ideas. Systematic Knowledge: Organizing and writing complex knowledge systematically deepens my understanding of various fields. Others A Programmer’s Standard: Many programmers maintain their own blog sites.

Path of Independent Development: Documenting thoughts, understanding, and product releases from the independent development journey. Project Participation: Highlighting significant open-source and personal projects. Exclusions Experimental Experiences: Small-scale coding experiments are not suitable for systematic blog content. Checklists: Standards for evaluating code quality or procedural checklists are better suited to other formats. Personal Thoughts: Casual personal reflections may not form valuable articles. Knowledge Integration: Consolidated knowledge that is already available elsewhere is not ideal for original blog content. Logs and Jottings: Casual logs and notes do not meet the professional standards of the blog. Sharing Sites and Tools: Content related to specific sites and tools does not fit the blog’s focus on systematic and professional content. Despite this, the blog will strive to maintain professionalism and focus on systematic and serious content. Readers are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions on any immature or unreasonable content. PS: Regarding exclusions: Not all accumulated knowledge will make it to the blog; I have a larger personal knowledge base suited for different purposes. Many topics are better suited to other records, improving efficiency and frequency of writing while maintaining the blog’s professionalism.

Here’s a brief overview of my blog journey: Mid-2018: I first considered blogging in my freshman year, exploring CSDN and Blog Park. Although I wrote a few articles on Blog Park, the platform’s limitations and risks made it less appealing. (Blog Park faced significant issues such as self-censorship, the rise of LLM-related web scraping, and maintenance difficulties.) End of 2018: Discovered HEXO and used its NEXT theme. While initially exciting, I found that static sites and HEXO’s limitations posed many issues. (Generated HTML cluttered my GitHub graph, and dynamic content was hard to manage.) 2019-2020: Due to academic and life pressures, the blog project was put on hold. In early 2020, I began using Markdown to organize interview notes and developed a simple FLASK backend for the blog. The project included two UI versions, available here: highestpeakscu-blog. Fall 2020: Rebuilt the blog with HALO, but server maintenance complexities and policy issues decreased my motivation to write. (HALO project also provided deeper insights into Spring.) 2021-2023: Due to transitions between study and work, the blog’s updates stalled. However, I accumulated a vast amount of knowledge, totaling around 380,000 words. 2024: With the rise of LLMs and the opportunity to apply for a Master’s program, I decided to relaunch the blog. The process of organizing knowledge has led to new ideas and needs, including complex technical issues from my work, insights into LLM and AI applications, and reflections on independent development.
